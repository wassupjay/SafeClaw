# Safeclaw

**Universal outbound data guard for AI agents.**

Safeclaw catches sensitive data (API keys, passwords, emails, credit cards) before an AI agent accidentally leaks it. Runs on-premise with zero external calls — works for local dev, CI/CD pipelines, and enterprise deployments alike.

Works with **any AI agent**: Claude Code, OpenClaw, ClaudeClaw, Codex, and more!

```bash
pip install safeclaw-guard
```

---

## Why This Exists

AI agents have access to your codebase, `.env` files, databases, and configs. When they generate output — a shell command, a file, an API call — they can accidentally include secrets in plaintext. The agent doesn't know it's leaking. Safeclaw stops that at the exit.

![Safeclaw flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wassupjay/SafeClaw/main/docs/flow.png)

**In plain English:** The AI agent reads your secrets to do its job. Safeclaw makes sure those secrets don't appear in the output.

### Block vs Redact

```
Input:  "Deploy with key sk-ant-api03-realkey123..."
Output: "[SAFECLAW BLOCKED] contains sensitive data: Anthropic API Key"

Input:  "Send report to john@acme.com and call 555-867-5309"
Output: "Send report to [REDACTED:EMAIL] and call [REDACTED:PHONE]"
```

Configurable per entity type — API keys block, emails redact. Your call.

**Colored CLI Output:** Blocked messages appear in red, redacted placeholders in yellow for better visibility.

## Get Started

Safeclaw supports multiple integration methods depending on your agent and workflow:

### 🤖 MCP-Compatible Agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, ClaudeClaw, etc.)

```bash
pip install safeclaw-guard
safeclaw install --mcp
```

Your MCP-compatible agent can now use Safeclaw's `safeclaw_scan` and `safeclaw_detect` tools automatically.

### 🐍 Python Code (Any Python Agent)

```python
from safeclaw import guard

result = guard("Contact john@acme.com with key sk-ant-api03-abc123...")
print(result.safe)      # False
print(result.blocked)   # True — API key detected
print(result.text)      # [SAFECLAW BLOCKED] ...
```

### 🌐 HTTP API (Any Language, Any Agent)

```bash
safeclaw serve   # starts on localhost:18791
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18791/scan \
  -H "X-Safeclaw-Secret: <secret>" \
  -d '{"text": "your text here"}'
```

### 💻 CLI Tool (Shell Scripts, CI/CD, Hooks)

```bash
pip install safeclaw-guard
safeclaw install  # For Claude Code specifically

# Or use directly:
echo "some text" | safeclaw scan
safeclaw scan < file.txt
# Control colors (enabled by default in terminals)
safeclaw scan --no-color  # Disable colored output```

## What It Detects

| Entity | Default | Examples |
|--------|---------|---------|
| API Keys | 🔴 Block | `sk-ant-...`, `AKIA...`, `ghp_...`, `sk_live_...` |
| Private Keys | 🔴 Block | PEM-encoded RSA/EC keys |
| Passwords | 🔴 Block | `password = "..."`, `postgres://user:pass@host` |
| Credit Cards | 🔴 Block | Visa, Mastercard, Amex (Luhn-validated) |
| SSNs | 🔴 Block | `123-45-6789` |
| JWTs | 🟡 Redact | `eyJhbG...` base64 tokens |
| Emails | 🟡 Redact | `user@domain.com` |
| Phone Numbers | 🟡 Redact | US and international formats |

## Architecture

![Safeclaw architecture diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wassupjay/SafeClaw/main/docs/arch.png)

- **Pipeline pattern** (spaCy/sklearn-inspired) — pluggable detectors. Ships with `RegexDetector`, drop in an ML model later without changing any code.
- **Pydantic v2 models** — typed `Span`, `Entity`, `GuardResult` following NER conventions.
- **Confidence scoring** — every match has a score (0.0–1.0). Only flags above your threshold.
- **Overlap resolution** — when two patterns match the same span, highest confidence wins.

---

## Configuration

```bash
safeclaw init    # creates .safeclaw.yaml
```

```yaml
threshold: 0.75       # confidence cutoff
fail_open: true       # if error: pass through (true) or block (false)

rules:
  api_key:    { action: block,  enabled: true }
  email:      { action: redact, enabled: true }
  phone:      { action: redact, enabled: true }
  ip_address: { action: redact, enabled: false }  # too noisy
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `safeclaw scan` | Scan stdin (also works as Claude Code hook) |
| `safeclaw serve` | HTTP server on localhost |
| `safeclaw mcp` | MCP stdio server |
| `safeclaw install` | Add to Claude Code |
| `safeclaw uninstall` | Remove from Claude Code |
| `safeclaw init` | Create config file |

---
